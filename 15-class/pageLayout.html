        <p>When Rashid Khan picked up his first IPL hat-trick it looked as if it is game, set and match. In 15 seasons the IPL has seen some extraordinary finishes and twists, but the one on Sunday was surreal. Kolkata needed 29 runs off the last over and after Umesh Yadav took a single off the first ball, it was over to Rinku Singh. He needed four sixes and a boundary or five sixes. This is the sort of moment everyone who picks the bat dreams about. And Yash Dayal delivered  three successive full-tosses, which were dispatched over long-off, deep square-leg and long-off as the equation came down to 10 off two deliveries. Out of nowhere Kolkata had not only come back into the game, but it was their game to lose. With pressure mounting and suggestions pouring from every quarter, Dayal delivered a back of the hand slower ball, which sat up perfectly for Rinku to smash it over long on. With four needed off the last ball,  Dayal delivered a short one outside off and at his pace, Rinku had no hesitation to deposit straight over the sight screen to seal an game that appeared all but lost only three overs ago</p>
